Description of the OI.v2 Monthly SST Analysis (v2 indicates version 2)


The NOAA OI.v2 SST monthly fields are derived by a linear interpolation of
the weekly optimum interpolation (OI) version 2 fields to daily fields then
averaging the daily values over a month. The monthly fields are in the
same format and spatial resolution as the weekly fields.

The OI.v2 analysis is described in Reynolds, R.W., N.A. Rayner, T.M. 
Smith, D.C. Stokes, and W. Wang, 2001: An Improved In Situ and Satellite 
SST Analysis for Climate, J. Climate, submitted. The paper has been 
accepted by the Journal of Climate subject to minor revisions. A preprint 
of the paper can be obtained in the directory:

   ftp://ftp.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/cmb/People/reynolds/oiv2pap/

The paper is presently in two word perfect files (oiv2_text.wpd and
oiv2_figs.wpd) and two word files (oiv2_text.doc and oiv2_figs.doc).
The first file is the text, the second is the figures.)



These fields are available in individual monthly files.  Each file is named 
oiv2mon.{YYYYMM}, where {YYYYMM} is the year and month of the field. 

Files in this directory ending with the extension '.gz' have been compressed 
using the gzip utility.

An interim file with just the most recent month or partial month is
available in oiv2mon.month.  This file will be re-written each week if 
we have sufficient weekly fields to linearly interpolate to the 15th 
of the month or beyond.



The files were written in IEEE binary (big-endian).
Each file contains three records described as follows:
   rec 1: date and version number        (8 4-byte integer words)
   rec 2: gridded sst values in degC     (360*180 4-byte real words)
   rec 3: gridded ice concentration      (360*180 1-byte integer words)

The ice field shows the approximate monthly average of the ice 
concentration values input to the SST analysis.  Ice concentration is 
stored as the percentage of are of area covered.  For the ice fields, the 
value 122 represents land or coast.  Note, the ice land mask is a function 
of the ice analysis and may change periodically.

The sst and ice fields are on a 1-degree (360 lon by 180 lat) grid.
The first gridbox of each array is centered on 0.5E, 89.5S.  The points
move eastward to 359.5E, then northward to 89.5N.


The OI analysis is done over all ocean areas and the Great Lakes.  
There is no analysis over land.  The land values are filled by a Cressman
interpolation to produce a complete grid for possible interpolation to 
other grids.  The ocean and land areas are defined by a land sea mask.  
This data set is a binary, direct access file, lstags.ondeg.dat, which 
is included in the same directory.  The spatial grid is defined identically 
to the grid for the SST arrays.  The values in ls.dat are set to 1 over 
the ocean and 0 over land. It can be read by the following fortran code:

      REAL*4 TAGLS(360,180)

c
c NOTE, recl definition below depends on compiler
c   (number of 4-byte words OR number of bytes)
c   choose one of following krecl definitintions
c     parameter(krecl=360*180)        ! number of 4-byte words
      parameter(krecl=360*180*4)      ! number of bytes
      open (24,file='lstags.onedeg.dat',form='unformatted',
     1   access='direct',recl=krecl)

c
c     Read in land sea tags (1 for ocean; 0 for land)
c
      READ (24,rec=1) TAGLS
      STOP 1
      END


The following sample fortran program reads the data and prints
out sample values:


c--------------  start of code -----------------------------------------

      program rdoimonv2 
c  read OI.v2 SST file and land mask and print selected values.

c  sst   - sea surface temperature array (deg C)
c  ice   - ice concentration array (%)  (0-100,   >100 = land or coast)
c  iyrst - year of start date of analysis
c  imst  - month of start date of analysis
c  idst  - day of start date of analysis
c  iyrnd - year of end date of analysis
c  imnd  - month of end date of analysis
c  idnd  - day of end date of analysis
c  ndays - number of days in analysis (start date thru enddate)
c  index - analysis version for reference
c  xlon  - longitude of center of grid square
c  xlat  - latitude of center of grid square
c  tagls - land/sea tag array (0=land, 1=water)

c  NOTES:  
c   - land values for sst do not necessarily coincide with land values 
c       from ice analysis
c   - recl definition for the direct access open depends on the compiler

Following are the results of the above code when reading the file 
for August 1993.  If your 'index' does not match the one 
shown below, you have a newer analysis version and your SST and ice
values likely will not match either.  Please feel free to 
request the correct output for your version to ensure you are 
reading the data correctly.
